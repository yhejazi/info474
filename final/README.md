# Final Project

We implemented an [explorable explanation](https://explorabl.es/) that uses interactive visualization, animation, and text to help people understand a complex process or phenomena (in our case, the Doppler Effect).

Our project is an Idyll document with explanations of the Doppler effect and how it creates redshift/blueshift, accompanied with interactive visualizations. 

Teammates: Joseph Chou, Vanessa Hsu
