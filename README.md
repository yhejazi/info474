Projects from INFO 474: Interactive Information Visualization

## Project 1: Visualization Design
This project tasked me to design a static visualization for a small data set and provide a rigorous rationale for my design choices. As different visualizations can emphasize different aspects of a dataset, I documented what aspects of the data I was attempting to most effectively communicate. In my rationale, I attempt to answer the questions:
1. What story (or stories) are you trying to tell? 
2. How do your visual encodings facilitate effective communication?

## Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
In this project, I had to formulate and answer a series of specific questions about a data set I chose about McDonald's nutrition facts. For each iteration of the question, I created a visualization that tries to answer the question. After answering the questions, I created a final visualization that is designed to provide the most informative answer to the questions I asked.

## Project 3: Creating Interactive Visualization Software
In this project, I explored the issues involved in implementing interactive visualization software. I chose to implement the interactive technique of a bubble chart using Javascript and D3 in order to allow exploration of video game sales. The goal with this project is not only to gain hands-on experience implementing a visualization technique, but also to think about the effectiveness of the specific visualization techniques re-implemented in the context of the data domain.

## Final Project
We implemented an [explorable explanation](https://explorabl.es/) that uses interactive visualization, animation, and text to help people understand a complex process or phenomena (in our case, the Doppler Effect).
